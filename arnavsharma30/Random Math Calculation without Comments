Sure, here is a sample of a random Python code with simple math operations and complex calculations without any comments and using 1-letter variable names:

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.random.randint(1, 10)
y = np.random.randint(1, 10)

a = x * y + x ** 2
b = np.sqrt(a)

c = np.log(b)
d = np.sin(c)

result = d + x * y

print(result)
```
