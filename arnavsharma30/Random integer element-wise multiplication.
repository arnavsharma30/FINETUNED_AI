Here is a random Python code snippet:

```
import numpy as np

x = np.random.randint(1, 100, 10)
y = np.random.randint(1, 100, 10)

z = x * y

print(z)
```

This code generates two arrays of random integers between 1 and 100, then performs element-wise multiplication on them using NumPy and prints the result.
